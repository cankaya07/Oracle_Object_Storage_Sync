Goetz's File Splitter.
This program, for Windows 95, 98, 
NT or higher, is designed to take a 
file and split it up into smaller 
pieces. This is useful for taking a 
file that can not fit on one floppy 
and then splitting it on many floppies. 
It can also be used where you are 
limited in file size, such as in 
e-mail attachments.
